Priority:
Condense one line IFs
Standards variable naming
Tidy up section headers/banners and file contents
if -m (max speed) option is low then etherate outputs "Max TX speed set to <1Mbps"
Dump test results even when using CTRL+C
Difference in definition between fSizeMax and fSizeDef

Frames less than 60bytes are padded by Linux upto 60, is it OK to rely on the kernel to do this?
Why when one end sends a double tagged from with 0x88a8 on the first etherype does the receiver of the frame always see it as two 0x8100 frames?
    // The displaid TX rate (19Mbps) on the TX host when testing with 20 byte frames is less than the RX host displaid RX rate (40Mbps)

    // No time out feature; for example, after 30 seconds the test should finish on the TX host (actually, this does happen sometimes?)

    // Display post test details; min max avg for Mbps and FrmRX/S

Medium:
Checking frame order
Detect lost frames
Should we print non default settings to the screen when the user sets them before the test starts to show what will happen?
Add the MEGA-DEBUG!!! option to the cli args?


Low:
Number of non test frames received
Add pps/frames per second maximum limit cli switch
Add option for DEI/CFI header bit
Doesn't work on my office desktop with a bridge interface
Print round trip delay as well as one way delay
Add option to ACK one in every 10 or every 100 frames
