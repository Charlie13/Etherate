Priority:
Checking frame order
Detect lost frames
finish ack and out of order frame counts and print out and in order frame counts at the end of the test
Don't get count of in/out order frames when CTRL+C in the middle of a test
Frames less than 60bytes are padded by Linux upto 60, is it OK to rely on the kernel to do this?

    // The displaid TX rate (19Mbps) on the TX host when testing with 20 byte frames is less than the RX host displaid RX rate (40Mbps)

    // No time out feature; for example, after 30 seconds the test should finish on the TX host (actually, this does happen sometimes?)

    // Display post test details; min max avg for Mbps and FrmRX/S


Medium:
130 is ret val for sig_handle in funcs.cpp
Change from using byte speed counters to bits or using -M will cause rounding inaccuracy when /8
Should we print non default settings to the screen when the user sets them before the test starts to show what will happen?
Add the MEGA-DEBUG!!! option to the cli args?


Low:
Feature to randomise frame payload per frame
Add pps/frames per second maximum limit cli switch
Add option for DEI/CFI header bit
Doesn't work on my office desktop with a bridge interface
Print round trip delay as well as one way delay
Add option to ACK one in every 10 or every 100 frames



Future Features:
For man page: Order of prefered interface names, eth0, en0 etc..wlan0
Add RFC2544 test
Add ITU Y.1564 tests
BERT tests
Add continual OWAMP tests
Add broadcast and multicast features for L2 storm style testings
Add feature to load frame payload from text file
Add BPDU sending
Add keepalive sending
Report throughput if IPv4 or v6 was used, if UDP or TCP was used.
