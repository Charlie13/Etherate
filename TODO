Priority:
TX host doesn't receive dying gasp
Condense one line IFs
Standards variable naming
Tidy up section headers/banners and file contents
if -m (max speed) option is low then etherate outputs "Max TX speed set to <1Mbps"
Dump test results even when using CTRL+C
RX host shows receiving traffic rate in Mbps with a deciaml place, TX host shows an integer without decimal? Remove deciaml place?
RX host shows the median for delay, TX does not? Mean, median, mode, choose one and standardise on both!



Medium:
Checking frame order
Detect lost frames
Should we print non default settings to the screen when the user sets them before the test starts to show what will happen?
Add the MEGA-DEBUG!!! option to the cli args?


Low:
Number of non test frames received
Add pps/frames per second maximum limit cli switch
Add option for DEI/CFI header bit
Doesn't work on my office desktop with a bridge interface
Print round trip delay as well as one way delay
Add option to ACK one in every 10 or every 100 frames
