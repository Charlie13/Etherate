1. Full compile

For a complete check and compile install, install any missing dependancies with the following (adjust to your OS as required):

sudo apt-get install automake autoconf libtool

Then simply run:

./configure.sh



2. Standalone binary compile

To compile the binary in the local directory use the following:

g++ -o etherate etherate.cpp -Wall -ftrapv -g -O3 -lrt



3. Standalone binary compile (with minimal checks, only for slags)

g++ -o etherate etherate.cpp
