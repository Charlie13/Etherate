1. Full compile

For a complete check and compile install, install any missing dependancies with the following (adjust to your OS as required):

sudo apt-get install automake autoconf libtool

The simply run:

./configure.sh





2. Stand alone binary compile

To just compile the binary in the local directory use the following:

g++ -o etherate etherate.cpp -lrt
