Etherate
========

What is it:


ITU-T Y.1564 

A Linux CLI program for testing a layer 2 Ethernet connections.

The original idea was to provide a simple speed testing program that with any modern day CPU could saturate a 
gigabit Ethernet link, with any typical off the shelf/on-board GigE NIC. Programs such as iPerf/jPerf (there are many others!) exist and are mostly excellent at this. They can saturate a link or connection to measure throughput or simulate congestion, but they operate at layer 4 of the OSI model, using either TCP or UDP for data transport. This is fine for WAN testings or testing over a layer 3 boundary, or across the Internet (Broadband diagnostics etc).

Hardware RFC2544 compliant testers can be used to test a layer 2 link end to end but these are typically very expensive and most techies are already carrying a laptop around. Its very likely that a peice of 100m Cat5e will run at 100Mbps/1Gbps between two switches within a building (and beyond to 115m~ if conditions permit). Etherate will work here but this was not the original design purpose. A layer 2 (Pseudowire/VPLS/EPLS) link from ISP XYZ between London and Berlin however, will pass over many devices, and likely over multiple layer 3 boarders, as layer 2 traffic is being tunneled across a network. This means that latency is an issue here. Also in hard-to-monitor situations such as Inter-AS MPLS where a Pseudowires cross the AS boarder, link congenstion and contention can be an issue (even with MPLS-TE). Etherate was desigend to work here.
