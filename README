Etherate
========


What is it:

  The original idea was to provide a simple speed testing program
  that with any modern day CPU could saturate a gigabit Ethernet link,
  with any typical off the shelf/on-board GigE NIC. Programs such as
  iPerf/jPerf (there are many others!) exist and are mostly excellent 
  at this. They can saturate a link or connection to measure throughput
  or simulate congestion, but they operate at layer 4 of the OSI model
  using either TCP or UDP for data transport. This is fine for WAN
  testings or testing over a layer 3 boundary, or across the Internet
  (home broadband or tail circuit diagnostics etc).

  Etherate is a Linux CLI program for testing layer 2 Ethernet circuits.

  
Why was it Made:  

  Hardware RFC2544 compliant testers can be used to test a layer 2 link
  end to end but these are typically very expensive and most techies are
  already carrying a laptop around. After the initial alhpa release 
  the goal for Etherate is to start to bring in RFC2544 and ITU-T Y.1564
  measurement compliance testing. Free Ethernet testing for all!
  

Features:

  In the initial alhpa stages it has basic features whilst the initial
  code is created;
  
  - Speed test
  - Delay measurement
  - VLAN tag and QinQ tag testing
  - VLAN (and QinQ) priority marking testing
  
  
Technical details:

  In the alpha stage Etherate is single threaded and only runs a single
  test between a transmitting and receiving host. Later development
  will see it turn to bidirectional testing.
